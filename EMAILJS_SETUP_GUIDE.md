```

## Troubleshooting:

### Form not sending?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all three IDs are correct
- Make sure your EmailJS service is connected and active

### Emails going to spam?
- Add your portfolio domain to EmailJS allowed domains
- Use a custom email template with proper formatting

### Monthly limit reached?
- Free plan: 200 emails/month
- Upgrade to paid plan for more emails

## Security Note:

The public key is safe to use in client-side code. EmailJS designed it to be public. However, consider adding:

1. **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
2. **reCAPTCHA** to prevent spam
3. **Domain restrictions** in EmailJS dashboard

## Free Plan Limits:

- âœ… 200 emails per month
- âœ… 2 email services
- âœ… 2 email templates
- âœ… Basic support

This is perfect for a personal portfolio!
